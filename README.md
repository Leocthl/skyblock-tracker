## Install instructions

 * Requires forge

 * Download and install Chattriggers mod from here: (ver 5.2): <https://github.com/ChatTriggers/ChatTriggers/releases>

   - NOTE: **THIS IS AN OLD VERSION OF CHATTRIGGERS.** But this script requires this version to work.
   - For some reason my Minecraft crashes with the newer versions of chattriggers so I have to use the old version.
I could include the jar file in this zip but I decided to just give the link for account safety concerns.

 * Before starting, open strings.txt and you will see zombiebasexp, spiderbasexp and wolfbasexp, change the number below them to your current zombie/spider/wolf xp in kilos (for example if you have 123,450 xp, change it to 123.45)

 * Then just copy the entire ChatTriggers folder to your mod folder

 * Type /d in Hypixel to open the menu. You can also open the menu and all submenus by typing /tr 0~6 anywhere.

 * Read more info by typing /tr 6 to open the help menu.
